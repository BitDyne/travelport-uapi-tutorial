# Basic Air Travel Requests

## Unit 1, Lesson 1

### Objective Of Lesson 2

After this lesson is completed you should know how to search for available flights and price itineraries using the Travelport Universal API.

### Workflow

This lesson, building on the [previous one](index.html), will allow you to do what most travel agents did in the past and what many still do today.  Their objective is to sell a trip to a customer, but to do that they need to do two basic tasks:

* Find a set of available flights that get the traveller from origin to destination (and often back)

* Given the set of flights, determine the price of that itinerary.
