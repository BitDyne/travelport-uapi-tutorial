<h1>Basic Air Travel Requests</h1>

<h2>Unit 1, Lesson 1</h2>

<h3>Objective Of Lesson 2</h3>

<p>After this lesson is completed you should know how to search for available flights and price itineraries using the Travelport Universal API.</p>

<h3>Workflow</h3>

<p>This lesson, building on the <a href="index.html">previous one</a>, will allow you to do what most travel agents did in the past and what many still do today.  Their objective is to sell a trip to a customer, but to do that they need to do two basic tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Find a set of available flights that get the traveller from origin to destination (and often back)</p></li>

<li><p>Given the set of flights, determine the price of that itinerary.</p></li>
</ul>
