### Needed improvements for FB App

App currently code named [Madeliene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_la_Madeleine).

To build a real application at least these improvements must be delivered:

* Popup window between picking a friend and launching a search.  This should allow input of a few travel details:
** One-Way/Round Trip
** Date(s) of travel
** Number of adults, number of children

* A "semi-booking" ability to submit an itinerary that ends up in the travel agents queue for ticketing and dealing with payment.  This should probably be connected automatically

* Improved geographic knowledge for big countries like China, Brazil, and Australia.  Currently we don't handle provinces or states of these countries.

* Better England county handling--we don't handle Scotland at all and there are many "county names" for England.

* Ability for either customer or agent to post on the user's timeline when booking travel.  Maybe when the travel agent confirms the purchase?
