<p>#Getting Started With The TravelPort Universal API</p>

<p>###Unit 1, Lesson 1</p>

<h3>WSDL</h3>

<p>Although these lessons are using Java the lessons concepts apply to pretty much any programming language.  The <em>interface</em> to the Universal API (uAPI) is defined with WSDL or Web Services Definition Language, pronounced &ldquo;whiz-dul&rdquo;.  This means that any programming language that knows how to &ldquo;use web services&rdquo; can access the APIs and get useful things done.  In practice, this means that you need a <em>generator</em> that can take a file &ldquo;foo.wsdl&rdquo; and spit out &ldquo;foo_client.java&rdquo; or whatever your favorite language.  Different generators have slightly different behaviors (of course, WSDL is a &ldquo;standard!&rdquo;); we&rsquo;ll be using <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/">Apache&rsquo;s CXF</a> to work with the uAPI in Java.  (&ldquo;CXF&rdquo; is not really an acronym in this case.)</p>
